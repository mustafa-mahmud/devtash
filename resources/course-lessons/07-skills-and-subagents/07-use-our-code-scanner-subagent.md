# Using Our Code Scanner Subagent

Let's now use our new subagent to find any issues and optimizations in our entire codebase.

Enter the following prompt:

```text
Use the code-scanner agent to check the entire codebase. Report your findings
```

## Results

Depending on your results, you may want to optimize/fix any issues. It will probably say a bunch of stuff is not implemented yet like authentication, which is to be expected.

If there are issues you think should be fixed that are quick wins, meaning little to no risk, add them as a new feature with the prompt below:

```text
We have not implemented some of this yet. We will work on it soon. Add any quick wins that carry little to no risk to the @context/current-feature.md file
```

Now we can run:

```bash
/feature start
```

It will most likely do things like:

- Add loading state with skeletons
- Validation
- Add error boundary
- try/catch in server components
- Database indexes
- Break up large files

Have it apply some of the changes and then test. For instance, have it add the error boundary and then change the DATABASE_URL and make sure you can see it.

Slow down the connection in the devtools and test the skeleton loading, etc.

Once done:

```bash
/feature review
/feature complete
```

Do you see how helpful this is as opposed to vibe coding and just letting it do what it wants? We are reviewing everything it does, testing and optimizing.

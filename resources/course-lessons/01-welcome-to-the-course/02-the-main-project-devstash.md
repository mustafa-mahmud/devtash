# The Main Project - Devstash

I want to go over the main project for this course. Now, this is very important... This is not like other course projects where the goal is to match exactly what I have. In my react course, you write the same exact code and end up with the same project. With AI, it's too unpredictable and there are too many variables. Even if you do use the same AI tool and the same LLM and the same exact prompts, you're still probably going to end up with something different. That's just how it goes. So don't look at this as your end result needs to match mine. Look at it as you are creating your own version of the same app.

With that said, I still want to show you what I ended up with. Your project will be similar abd will use the same stack, but may not look the exact same and definitely won't have the same exact code.

## About Devstash

So, to give you a brief overview of what this project is, it's called Devstash and it is a project that I actually wanted to create for a while. Normally, as developers, we have stuff scattered everywhere. Code snippets in our editor and multiple files, prompts in our AI tools, commands in the terminal and files, links in bookmarks, notes in whatever note app. I wanted a single place for all your developer related resources.

Before we get into the demo, let's talk about the tech stack. This isn't a vibe coded project where we let the AI select everything for us. I selected what is basically my favorite stack for most web projects.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js: Our main framework will be Next.js. I'll be using the latest at this time, which is version 16 along with React 19.
- TypeScript: Of course, we'll be using TypeScript. These days, unless you're an absolute beginner, you should always use TypeScript over regular JavaScript. It's so simple to integrate and is now the default with most Boilerplate setups.
- Neon PostgreSQL: For a database, we'll be using Neon, which is a serverless Postgres database, and my absolute favorite for pretty much any web app. You can use the free tier for this project, which is very generous and then scale from there if needed. The days of installing Postgres locally or going through some crazy UI to get setup are long gone. A project name and a couple clicks and you're in business. We'll be creating a development branch and a production branch for Devstash.
- Prisma ORM: To connect and interact with our database within our app, we'll use Prisma. Prisma allows us to create data models and then run migrations to create tables with columns and rows. We then use the Prisma client to run queries and other operations rather than having to use raw SQL.
- CloudFlare R2: For file and image storage, we'll be using Cloudflare R2, which in my opinion, is easier to setup than something like Amazon S3. It's also compatible with the S3 SDK, so we will be using that.
- Tailwind & ShadCN UI: For the UI, we'll use Tailwind v4 for styling and ShadCN UI for the reusable UI components.
- NextAuth: We'll use NextAuth v5 for authentication, which will include email/password login as well as GitHub Oauth. We'll have email verification, forgot password and all the necesseties of authentication and authorization.
- Claude Code: For our main AI tool and workflow, we'll be using Claude Code. You're welcome to use something else if you want though. I'll talk more about this later.

There will be a bunch of other smaller libraries as well. Resend for email verification, Upstash with Redis for rate limiting, the Stripe SDK for payments and a bunch of other stuff, this is defenitley a real-world project, not a little todo-list course project. We'll also be doing a complete deployment to Vercel.


## Demo 

Let's have a very quick look at the demo.

So this is the homepage, which is one of the later things we do. We start on the dashboard first, so let's look at that.

From the dashboard, you have 7 types of items:

- Snippets
- Prompts
- Commands
- Notes
- Files
- Images
- Links

Some of these may have different fields than the others, but they are all stored in the "items" table. We left it open to be able to add custom item types later on as well.

Now in addition to items, we have collections. You can add multiple items to collections and they can be items of different types. So we may have a DevOps collection with Docker commands, Github Action snippets, links, etc.

The dashboard shows collections, recent and pinned items, stats, etc.

We can create, update, delete and read collections and items, we can also favorite them. Items can be pinned to the top as well.

Files and images have a screen that is a little different. These are uploaded and hosted on Cloudflare R2.

## Item Drawer

One of the main selling points of this app is that you can save your stuff and access it quick. There is a search palette if you hit command+k. You also have your favorites and when you click an item, it opens a quick item drawer to give you what you need. We implement a code editor called Monaco. The user has settings to control the feel of it. And we use React Markdown for the other item types. 

## Authentication

Authentication uses Next Auth v5. We use the credentials and Github provider. Since we use Prisma, we implement the Prisma adapter. We also use Redis through Upstash for rate limiting.

## Stripe Payments & Pro Users

Another big part of this project is the Stripe payments and the feature gating for pro users. We'll have a free account that will allow users to create up to 50 items and 3 collections. If they want more than that, they need to upgrade to a pro account, which is unlimited and comes with other extra features.

Free users can use all items types except for files and images. These will stored remotely in Cloudflare R2 buckets. This is similar to Amazon S3. In fact, it's compatible with the S3 SDK.

## AI Features

Pro users also get access to AI features. There are 4 features and they all use the GPT-5-nano model. The features are the following:

- Auto Tagging: When a user creates an item, you can click "Suggest Tags" and it will create tags going by the title and other fields in the form
- Description Generation: We can also do the same thing for the description. You paste your snippet or whatever, then just click the button and it will generate a description based on the snippet or content.
- Prompt Optimization: We also have prompt optimization, where if you store a prompt, the AI will create a better one that it sees fit and you can compare the two and select the one you want
- Explain This Code: This is my favorite of the 4. We have a button on snippets and commands that will have the AI explain exactly what the code or command does. It's very thorough and opens in a new tab. It does take up to 20 or 30 seconds. I may try and find a way to make that a bit quicker.

We also have the settings page where you can delete your account, reset your password and see your stats.

So even though it's a relatively simple app, we're developing it front to back even up to the point of launching with a domain.

Just keep in mind, this is different than other courses, so if you end up with a different result, that is absolutely fine. It's all about the workflow, not the project itself.

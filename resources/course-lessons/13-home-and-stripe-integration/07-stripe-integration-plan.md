# Stripe Integration Plan

So you should have your Stripe account setup. We will be using the Stripe package, which allows us to let our users manage their subscription through a portal. So they can cancel, upgrade, etc.

## Creating A Plan

We need to figure out how this integration will work. We can have the AI help with that. We should have what we need in the database already because we described it in the initial project overview. We have an **isPro** field that will be true if a user is a paid one. We also have a couple Stripe-related fields in the user table.

Let's use our research command to figure this out and document it.

## Research Spec

First, let's create a new file to have the research command create the implementation documentation for us. Copy `/docs/research/stripe-integration-research.md` and copy the content from the course file `/research-files/stripe-integration-research.md`.

Now run the following command:

```text
/research stripe-integration-research.md
```

This should go through the code and database and construct a document at `docs/stripe-integration.md`.

#### Why `docs` and not `context`?

You could put this in the context so that it is always referenced, however since it is a one-time implementation, I don't think it belongs in context. So we will put it in the root of the `docs` folder and then we can reference it when needed.

Look over that file and make sure it is what you want.

## Stripe Integration Feature Specs

We have documentation about how our Stripe integration should work. Now we need to create a feature spec file that we can load into the current-feature.md file.

This is a huge feature, so I would suggest breaking it up into multiple spec files and doing one at a time. We will create two files. One to do the core implementation, add the `isPro` field to the session, etc and then a second one for the UI stuff.

Let's use a prompt to create our feature spec files:

```
Create two feature spec files for Stripe integration - Phase 1 (core infrastructure) and Phase 2 (integration & UI). Use @docs/stripe-integration-plan.md for reference. Phase 1 should include unit tests for usage-limits module. Phase 2 covers webhooks, feature gating, and UI components that require Stripe CLI for testing. 
```

We will install the Stripe CLI soon. We need this to use webhooks during development, which I will also explain soon.

In the next lesson, we will load these feature specs and run them.

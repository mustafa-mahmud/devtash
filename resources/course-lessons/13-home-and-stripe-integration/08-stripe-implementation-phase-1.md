# Stripe Implementation Phase 1

We have documentation about how our Stripe integration should work. We also have the 2 feature spec files.

## Phase 1 Implementation

Let's load the first one into the current-feature file:

```
/feature load stripe-phase1-spec.md
```

This will load the current feature.

You can take a look at `context/current-feature.md`.

Now let's run it:

```text
/feature start
```

It will create a todo list including:

- Stripe SDK install and config
- Usage limits module: This will keep free users from using more than allocated.
- Subscription server actions
- NextAuth types include **isPro**
- Add **isPro** to session
- Write unit tests

It should do all it needs and then run the tests.

If it all passes, we should be good to commit. There is really nothing else we can do because the UI is phase 2. So we have to trust the unit tests.

Let's review and complete:

```text
/feature review
/feature complete
/clear
```
